# 🗡️🐯🛡️ Obsidian Honor Coders (OHC)

Welcome to the digital forge of **Obsidian Honor Coders**.  
We are a specialized collective of developers dedicated to high-quality software engineering.  
We draw inspiration from the structural perfection and the ancient sharpness of **Mesoamerican Obsidian**.

> **"Sharp Logic. High RPM. Unshakable Integrity."**

We forge software with the precision of ancient obsidian and the high-revving performance of an overhead cam engine.

We don't just ship code; we build machines.

### 🛠️ Our Engineering Philosophy (The OHC Standard)

We treat code like a high-performance engine. Here is our Manifesto

| Virtue | Technical Meaning | The OHC Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Integrity** | Pure Logic | We do not ship "hacks" that we aren't willing to fix later. |
| **Courage** | Refactoring | We are not afraid to delete bad code, even if we wrote it ourselves. |
| **Discipline** | Documentation | We document our scripts so the next warrior can pick up the blade. |
| **Loyalty** | Peer Review | We protect the main branch like a fortress; no bug passes the gate. |
